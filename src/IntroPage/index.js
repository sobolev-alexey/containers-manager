Emails, phone calls and uncertainty are the daily details of moving goods.

                  As a result, shipping suffers from daily problems such as containers and trucks standing idle, cash flow tied up in goods waiting in ports, delays and a costly lack of coordination.<br /><br />Frequently documents go missing with limited indication of location, visibility of inventory or cargo status.<br /><br />The existing paper process used as a basis for the shipping economy only serves to slow down international trade.

                  Tomorrow’s supply chain is supported by a distributed ledger where original documents and events are reported in real time and made available to authorized actors. It will provide transparency to the process and allow everyone to piggy-back on the original data.<br /><br />New blockchain solutions have emerged to tackle supply chains challenges. However, these technologies were not created to handle the scale of international trade and transaction fees can quickly become costly.
